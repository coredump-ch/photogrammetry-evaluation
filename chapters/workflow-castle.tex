Data visualization is definitely nothing new. Neither is software to do
statistical analysis or 3D model generation. And 3D printers have been around
since 1984. But what happens if all these things are combined? By doing that,
data visualization is taken to a physical level.

The main goal of data visualization is its ability to \textbf{visualize data},
communicating information clearly and effectively.} \\ \medskip

Data visualization tries to make raw data more easily accessible. Changes in
datapoints over time should be visible, relations between different datasets
should become apparent, and at the same time the visualization should be easy to
understand and pleasant to look at.
